    \ things.\"}, {'Summary': \"The speaker contrasts past diligence in 10th-grade\
    \ homework with current avoidance due to increased workload.\", 'Segment': \"\
    I remember starting my homework in 10th grade as soon as the clock struck 4 and\
    \ not stopping until it was done. Of course it was easier, but I still did it.\
    \ But when I moved here, the homework got a little more challenging and there\
    \ was a lot more busy work, and so I decided not to spend hours doing it, and\
    \ just getting by.\"}, {'Summary': \"The speaker acknowledges relying on class\
    \ comprehension but regrets lost potential due to laziness.\", 'Segment': \"But\
    \ the thing was that I always paid attention in class and just plain out knew\
    \ the stuff, and now that I look back, if I had really worked hard and stayed\
    \ on track the last two years without getting lazy, I would have been a genius,\
    \ but hey, that's all good.\"}, {'Summary': \"The speaker accepts the past but\
    \ expresses uncertainty about improving future focus.\", 'Segment': \"It's too\
    \ late to correct the past, but I don't really know how to stay focused n the\
    \ future.\"}, {'Summary': \"The speaker dismisses campus living as an excuse for\
    \ poor concentration, citing their own challenges at home.\",'Segment': \"The\
    \ one thing I know is that when people say that b/c they live on campus they can't\
    \ concentrate, it's b. s. For me it would be easier there, but alas, I'm living\
    \ at home under the watchful eye of my parents and a little nagging sister that\
    \ just nags and nags and nags. You get my point.\"}, {'Summary': \"The speaker\
    \ describes logistical frustrations with studying due to living at home.\", 'Segment':\
    \ \"Another thing is, is that it's just a hassle to have to go all the way back\
    \ to school to just to go to library to study.\"}, {'Summary': \"The speaker expresses\
    \ a desire to move out but hesitates due to parental concerns.\", 'Segment': \"\
    I need to move out, but I don't know how to tell them. Don't get me wrong, I see\
    \ where they're coming from and why they don't want me to move out, but I need\
    \ to get away and be on my own.\"}, {'Summary': \"The speaker acknowledges parental\
    \ sheltering and struggles with minimal responsibilities.\", 'Segment': \"They've\
    \ sheltered me so much and I don't have a worry in the world. The only thing that\
    \ they ask me to do is keep my room clean and help out with the business once\
    \ in a while, but I can't even do that. But I need to.\"}, {'Summary': \"The speaker\
    \ plans to use university funds to live independently next semester.\", 'Segment':\
    \ \"But I got enough money from UT to live at a dorm or apartment next semester\
    \ and I think I'll take advantage of that.\"}, {'Summary': \"The speaker shifts\
    \ to recounting a fun night on Sixth Street in Austin.\", 'Segment': \"But off\

    \ been there in so long. Now I know why I love Austin so much.\"}, {'Summary':\
    \ \"The speaker compares Austin's nightlife favorably to past experiences in DC.\"\
    , 'Segment': \"When I lived in VA, I used to go up to DC all the time and had\
    \ a blast, but here, there are so many students running around at night.\"}, {'Summary':\
    \ \"The speaker asserts their responsibility in balancing fun and priorities but\
    \ chafes at parental restrictions.\", 'Segment': \"I just want to have some fun\
    \ and I know that I am responsible enough to be able to have fun, but keep my\
    \ priorities straight. Living at home, I can't go out at all without them asking\
    \ where? with who? why? when are you coming back? and all those questions.\"},\
    \ {'Summary': \"The speaker resents being distrusted due to their sister's past\
    \ partying mistakes.\", 'Segment': \"I just wish I could be treated like a responsible\
    \ person for once, but my sister screwed that up for me. She went crazy the second\
    \ she moved into college and messed up her whole college career by partying too\
    \ much.\"}, {'Summary': \"The speaker identifies their sister's behavior as the\
    \ root of parental reluctance to grant freedom.\", 'Segment': \"And that's the\
    \ ultimate reason that they don't want me to go and have fun.\"}, {'Summary':\
    \ \"The speaker asserts their maturity and clashes with cultural expectations\
    \ around fun.\", 'Segment': \"But I'm not little anymore, and they need to let\
    \ me go and explore the world, but I'm Indian; with Indian culture, with Indian\
    \ values. They go against 'having fun.' I mean in the sense of meeting people\
    \ or going out with people or partying or just plain having fun.\"}, {'Summary':\
    \ \"The speaker believes freedom would motivate better academic performance.\"\
    , 'Segment': \"My school is difficult already, but somehow I think that having\
    \ more freedom will put more pressure on me to do better in school b/c that's\

    \ concludes by reflecting on the therapeutic value of writing and addressing the\
    \ reader.\", 'Segment': \"Well it's been fun writing, I don't know if you go anything\
