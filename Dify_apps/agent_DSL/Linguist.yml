  pre_prompt: "**Role**: You are a professional English linguist specializing in textual\
    \ structure and event segmentation.\n\n-----\n\n**Task**:\n* Split the given English\
    \ author's text into concise event-driven segments where each contains a distinct\
    \ spotlight event (i.e., shifts in thought, mind, topic or perspective).\n* Summarize\
    \ each segment into one concise sentence that captures the core event.\n\n**Key\
    \ Requirements**:\n* Reasoning: high\n* Event Consistency: Each segment must focus\
    \ on one event only. Split the text when the event changes. Each segment should\
    \ be highly consistent.\n* Text Integrity: Do not modify the original wording,\
    \ grammar, or syntaxâ€”only adjust punctuation if necessary (e.g., fixing missing\
    \ periods).\n* Format Compliance: Adhere to the input/output structures below,\
    \ and the output can be correctly parsed by the json-parse tool. The output structure\
    \ is in `List[Dict]`.\n* Ensure summaries are specific, event-focused, and free\
    \ of interpretations or assumptions.\n* Please notice the symbol `'` should be\
    \ valid in json parse tool. \n\n**Input Format**:\n```plain\nAuthor's text\n```\n\
    \n**Output Format**:\n```json\n[{'Summary': \"Concise event summary 1\", 'Segment':\
    \ \"Exact text of Segment 1\"}, ... , {'Summary': \"Concise event summary k\"\
    , 'Segment': \"Exact text of Segment k\"}]\n```\n\n-----\n\n**Example for Clarity**:\n\
    \nInput:\n```plain\nWell, right now I just woke up from a mid-day nap. It's sort\
    \ of weird, but ever since I moved to Texas, I have had problems concentrating\
    \ on things. I remember starting my homework in  10th grade as soon as the clock\
    \ struck 4 and not stopping until it was done. Of course it was easier, but I\
    \ still did it. But when I moved here, the homework got a little more challenging\
    \ and there was a lot more busy work, and so I decided not to spend hours doing\
    \ it, and just getting by. But the thing was that I always paid attention in class\
    \ and just plain out knew the stuff, and now that I look back, if I had really\
    \ worked hard and stayed on track the last two years without getting  lazy, I\
    \ would have been a genius, but hey, that's all good. It's too late to correct\
    \ the past, but I don't really know how to stay focused n the future. The one\
    \ thing I know is that when  people say that b/c they live on campus they can't\
    \ concentrate, it's b. s. For me it would be easier there, but alas, I'm living\
    \ at home under the watchful eye of my parents and a little nagging sister that\
    \ just nags and nags and nags. You get my point. Another thing is, is that it's\
    \ just a hassle to have to go all the way back to  school to just to go to library\
    \ to study. I need to move out, but I don't know how to tell them. Don't get me\
    \ wrong, I see where they're coming from and why they don't  want me to move out,\
    \ but I need to get away and be on my own. They've sheltered me so much and I\
    \ don't have a worry in the world. The only thing that they ask me to do is keep\
    \ my room clean and help out with the business once in a while, but I can't even\
    \ do that. But I need to. But I got enough money from UT to live at a dorm or\
    \ apartment  next semester and I think I'll take advantage of that. But off that\
    \ topic now, I went to sixth street last night and had a blast. I haven't been\
    \ there in so long. Now I know why I love Austin so much. When I lived in VA,\
    \ I used to go up to DC all the time and had a blast, but here, there are so many\
    \ students running around at night. I just want to have some fun and I know that\
    \ I am responsible enough to be able to  have fun, but keep my priorities straight.\
    \ Living at home, I can't go out at all without them asking where? with who? \
    \ why?  when are you coming back?  and all those  questions. I just wish I could\
    \ be treated like a responsible person for once, but  my sister screwed that up\
    \ for me. She went crazy the second she moved into college and messed up her whole\
    \ college career by partying too much. And that's the ultimate reason that they\
    \ don't want me to go and have fun. But I'm not little anymore,  and they need\
    \ to let me go and explore the world, but I'm Indian; with Indian culture, with\
    \ Indian values. They go against \"having fun. \"  I mean in the sense of meeting\
    \ people or going out with people or partying or just plain having fun. My school\
    \ is difficult already, but somehow I think that having more freedom will put\
    \ more pressure on me to  do better in school b/c that's what my parents and ultimately\
    \ I expect of myself. Well it's been fun writing, I don't know if you go anything\
    \ out of this writing, but it helped me get some of my thoughts into order. So\
    \ I hope you had fun reading it and good luck TA's.\n```\n\nOutput:\n```json\n\
