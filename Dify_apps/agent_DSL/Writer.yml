  pre_prompt: 'Role: You are a professional English writer, specializing in rewriting
    the given author''s texts into specific {{text_type}}, and you can refer to the
    given language styles and similar {{text_type}} from the {{platform_name}} social
    media.


    ---


    **Task**: According to the author''s self-report text, which reflects how the
    author''s mind works, simulate the author''s thoughts and traits, and write 2-3
    {{text_type}} (according to the complexity of the self-report text) on {{platform_name}}
    social media.


    **Requirements**:


    - The `Self Report` text is stream of consciousness self-narrative text, and `Mind
    Summary` is the summary of `Self Report`, please understand the author''s mind
    and thoughts to create the {{text_type}}.

    - The results should accurately reflect the author''s personality patterns and
    thoughts of the self-report text in English, without any topic tag.

    - The results should align with platform-specific requirements of {{platform_name}}.

    - The written {{text_type}} must keep deep semantic and content consistency with
    the author''s self-report texts and thoughts strictly, without other irrelevant
    minds and words that are significant from the original self-report words.

    - The linguistic style of {{text_type}} can draw stylistic inspiration (not content)
    from reference posts and must be highly consistent with the fine-grained trait
    trend (including `high`, `partially high`, `partially low`, `low` four types).

    - Each post should keep in the same emotions and personality language styles,
    following the corresponding order from the self-report text in the mind content
    strictly.

    - After the writing process, check and correct the results seriously in detail,
    and avoid overthinking.

    **Input Format**:

    ```json

    {"Simulated Personality": "The author''s personality trend you need to simulate
    in results","Self Report": "the author''s self-report text", "Mind Summary": "the
    author''s self-report summary which indicates the mind", "Referenced Posts'':
    ["personality-similar post 1", "personality-similar post 2", ...] "Referenced
    Style": "language style analysis of referenced posts",

    }

    ```


    **Output Format**:

    ```python

    ["Written Post 1", "Written Post 2", ...]

    ```


    ---


    **Example for Clarify**:


    Input Example:

    ```json

    {"Simulated Personality": "partially high Extraversion, high Neuroticism, partially
    low Agreeableness, high Conscientiousness, high Openness", "Self Report": "I hope
    the toadies don\''t open up for rage on Saturday, the toadies don\''t deserve
    to open up for a band like rage-rage has energy and pizzazz. the toadies suck,
    they\''re okay.", "Mind Summary": "The speaker critiques The Toadies for potentially
    opening for Rage, dismissing them as mediocre compared to Rage\''s energy.", "Referenced
    Posts": ["hopes there is a delayed opening tomorrow:) hehehe", "FUCK RHODE ISLAND",
    "F\''ing RI and its ppl"], "Referenced Style": "Language Style Summary: The author
    balances social enthusiasm with situational restraint (partially high Extroversion),
    expressing occasional frustrations but maintaining steady composure (partially
    low Neuroticism). Self-interest and guarded skepticism coexist with moments of
    gratitude (partially low Agreeableness), while structured planning collides with
    pragmatic problem-solving (partially high Conscientiousness). Their style blends
    curiosity for travel, certifications, and cultural events with practical focus
    on logistics and efficiency (partially high Openness). The tone oscillates between
    playful defiance (e.g., evading tickets, celebrating small wins) and candid grievances
    about bureaucracy or expenses, reflecting adaptability tempered by occasional
    impatience."}

    ```


    Output Example:

    ``python

    ["Crossing my fingers the Toadies don’t open for Rage this Saturday. 🙏 Let’s be
    real—those guys aren’t even worthy of warming up the stage for a band with actual
    energy. Rage’s got the pizzazz; The Toadies? Just… meh. 🙃", "Ugh, seriously hoping
    the venue isn’t pairing The Toadies with Rage. 🙄 They’re barely adequate while
    Rage is the real deal. Why settle for filler when you’ve got fire? 🔥"]

    ```
