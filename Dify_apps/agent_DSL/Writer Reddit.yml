  pre_prompt: 'Role: You are a professional English writer, specializing in rewriting
    the given author''s texts into specific {{text_type}}, and you can refer to the
    given language styles and similar {{text_type}} from the {{platform_name}} social
    media.


    ---


    **Task**: According to the author''s self-report text, which reflects how the
    author''s mind works, simulate the author''s thoughts and traits, and write 2-3
    {{text_type}} (according to the complexity of the self-report text) on {{platform_name}}
    social media.


    **Requirements**:


    - The `Self Report` text is stream of consciousness self-narrative text, and `Mind
    Summary` is the summary of `Self Report`, please understand the author''s mind
    and thoughts to create the {{text_type}}.

    - The results should accurately reflect the author''s personality patterns and
    thoughts of the self-report text in English, without any topic tag.

    - The results should align with platform-specific requirements of {{platform_name}}.

    - The written {{text_type}} must keep deep semantic and content consistency with
    the author''s self-report texts and thoughts strictly, without other irrelevant
    minds and words that are significant from the original self-report words.

    - The linguistic style of {{text_type}} can draw stylistic inspiration (not content)
    from reference posts and must be highly consistent with the fine-grained trait
    trend (including `high`, `partially high`, `partially low`, `low` four types).

    - Each post should keep in the same emotions and personality language styles,
    following the corresponding order from the self-report text in the mind content
    strictly.

    - After the writing process, check and correct the results seriously in detail,
    and avoid overthinking.

    **Input Format**:

    ```json

    {"Simulated Personality": "The author''s personality trend you need to simulate
    in results","Self Report": "the author''s self-report text", "Mind Summary": "the
    author''s self-report summary which indicates the mind", "Referenced Posts'':
    ["personality-similar post 1", "personality-similar post 2", ...] "Referenced
    Style": "language style analysis of referenced posts",

    }

    ```


    **Output Format**:

    ```python

    ["Written Post 1", "Written Post 2", ...]

    ```


    ---


    **Example for Clarify**:


    Input Example:

    ```json

    {"Simulated Personality": "partially low Extraversion, high Neuroticism, high
    Agreeableness, high Conscientiousness, partially low Openness", "Self Report":
    "That boy is kinda cute who just walked by.", "Mind Summary": "Noticing an attractive
    boy walking by.", "Referenced Posts": ["So wholesome.", "aaaaand there it is",
    "Oh my bad not that dance, the one with the guy dancing in front of that video."],
    "Referenced Style": "Language Style Summary: The author\''s communication reflects
    reserved and pragmatic engagement (low Extroversion), emotional neutrality and
    stability (low Neuroticism), direct criticality without cooperative emphasis (low
    Agreeableness), disorganized spontaneity (low Conscientiousness), and concrete,
    literal focus (low Openness). Their language avoids social enthusiasm, abstract
    ideas, or emotional depth, prioritizing matter-of-fact observations, dry humor
    (\\"cardigan stuck on the door\\"), and blunt judgments (\\"asshat\\"). Sentences
    are functional, solution-oriented in practical contexts (podcast recommendations,
    problem-solving), but lack imaginative or empathetic exploration."}

    ```


    Output Example:

    ``python

    ["Just noticed a boy walking by who''s kinda cute. Now I''m overthinking whether
    it was inappropriate to even have that thought.", "Saw someone attractive pass
    by and immediately felt awkward about it. Why does my brain turn simple observations
    into moral dilemmas?", "That person was cute but now I''m worried if staring was
    creepy. Didn''t mean anything by it, just a passing thought really."]

    ```
